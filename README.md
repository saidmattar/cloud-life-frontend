## Description of our Service

Cloud Life is your life, in the cloud: a secure document storage solution for anyone who wants to keep their documents online.

Users can create accounts which allow them to upload documents, files, photos, and more to an online bucket on Amazon's S3. Users can also create and join groups, allowing them to quickly share files with other group members.

## How to Use
Simply visit our website //TODO: DEPLOYED URL// to create an account. Sign up for an account with a username, password, and email - or simply sign in with a Google account (such as Gmail).

Sign in and you'll have access to your own cloud-based storage in which to stash whatever you please. You can create groups to share documents with others as well!

## FAQs

## Upcoming Features
With three team members and just four days, we didn't have time to get to every feature we'd like to build! Since we knew we would not have time to get to everything, we expanded our schemas to include details which could be used in future features, such as the "priority" or "safeStatus" keys on our Profile model. Future futures we'd like to implement include:
+ Passwords on individual documents for extra security
+ A "Mark Yourself as Secure" button, so you can easily update a group to your status in an emergency or natural disaster
+ Document expiration dates and/or permission-to-view inheritance dates
+ Integration with more services (Facebook, Instagram, Flickr, etc)

## Link to Backend Docs
Documentation for the backend of this project is located on Github [here](https://github.com/saidmattar/cloud-life-backend).

## Sample Use Cases
+ Use Cloud Life as a backup for your computer
+ Store all those photos of your vacations, kids, holidays, etc in the cloud without having to host them on a social media platform. Easily share with friends or family without requiring them to use Facebook, Instagram, etc.  
+ Keep tabs on your government records (such as birth certificates, immigration papers) in one easy place without risking them getting lost by officials or in the mail
+ Put your tax records in the cloud so they are easily accessible from year to year without digging through paperwork
+ Keep digital copies of documents, so you'll never lose them in a natural disaster (such as a flood or fire)
